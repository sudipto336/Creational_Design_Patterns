Thread safe singleton class can be created by synchronize method (for getting instance of sinleton class) using lock

Using lock on a shared resource ensures that that can be accessed by a single thread at a time

by that time other thread needs to wait for the resource to be free

once lock on the resource by a thread is released, then other thread is allowed to use the resource

as the instance creation is locked only 1 thread can create thread and other thread needs to wait 

so multiple instance will not be created
