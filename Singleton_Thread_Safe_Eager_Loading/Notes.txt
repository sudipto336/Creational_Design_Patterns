Eager loading is intialization of instance (at app startup) before it is actually needed to make it available (in memory) immidiately (ready to use immidiately) when it is required

it consumes memory/resource even if the instance is never used

it can be used if the obj creation is not expensive (lightweight and cheap) and quick and it is required to make available immidiately when required

CLR takes care of null checking, thread safety, instance initialization - we dont need to write code to handle these
