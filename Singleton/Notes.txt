Object of singleton class can not be created outside the class and can be created only once inside the class

Singleton class should have - 1 private constructor, a static method which will create instance only once and returns that instance whenever called, a static property to hold the instance

Singlton class should be sealed so that other class can not inherit that class

Singleton class can be used in logging, caching, database connection pool etc.

Singleton class is useful for managing concurrent access of shared resource by multiple clients or creating expensive instance creaion which can reduce performance if created multiple times
