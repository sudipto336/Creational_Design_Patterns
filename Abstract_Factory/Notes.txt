Factory of factories - a factory creates multiple factories

Sub classes of an abstract factory class, provides instances of multiple families of related product

components - abstract factory, concrete factory, abstract product, concrete product, client

this pattern can be used to create multiple families of related product instances

each concrete factory class creates instances of products of same family -  makes app consistent

in this pattern, product instance creation and product instance usage in client

in this pattern, new product can be added to family of the product without modifying client code - makes app flexible and scalable

this can be used for supporting multiple configurations for each env

this pattern hides obj creation process from client - useful for complex obj creation

abstract factory vs factory method - 

abstract factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related product instances through its subclasses - so no need to specify concrete product

factory method pattern provides an interface to create product instances through its subclasses - subclasses decide instance of which class needs to be created

in abstract factory, a single factory class creates multiple related product instances

in factory method pattern , a single factory class creates a single product instance

abstract factory - more complex and more flexible - as multiple related instances needs to be handled by a factory

factory method - less complex and less flexible - as single instance needs to be handled by a factory

abstract factory - used when multiple related instances needs to be created at 1 place and if no need to inform the client about how instances are created

factory method - used when a class cant decide which obj needs to be created rather it allows sub class to decide which obj needs to be created

in abstract factory, a factory class contains multiple factory methods to create different types of objs

in factory method, a factory class (sub class) contains single factory method to create a single type of obj
